# passwordgen

- Password Generator is my third homework assignment in my full-stack Bootcamp program, and, since Javascript is a new language for me, I struggled heavily trying to understand and code this assignment correctly. Half way through the assignment, I needed to get help from the TA, which is explains why I didn't make a lot of commits. In a couple of weeks - a month, I hope to look back on this project and fully understand all the work that I did on this page.

- I rewatched the TA's step-by-step video that was similar to my homework, and I added the following before I got stumped:
    - three arrays
    - if statements
    - and, my for loops

- After I added my for loops, I didn't understand what I needed to do next. The TA told me that I needed to add an additional assignment &lt;+=&gt;. And the additional assignment would be password and character variety.

- After the additional assignment, the TA told me that I needed to add a return statement under my for loops. Once the user picks their length and characters, the password would show, and the loop would stop.

- After that, he told me that I needed to wrap my if statements, alerts, and my for loops in a generate password function.

- Lastly, he told me that I needed two alerts just if the user doesn't choose at least one character or, their password length isn't between 8 & 128, which required the "or" operator.
