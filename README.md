# passwordgen

- Password Generator is my third homework assignment in my full-stack Bootcamp program, and, since Javascript is a new language for me, I'm going to try my best to make this password generator work!

I rewatched my instructor's step-by-step video that was similar to my homework, and I added the following before I got stumped:
three arrays
if statements
and, my for loops
After I added my for loops, I didn't understand what I needed to do next. My instructor told me that I needed to add an additional assignment &lt;+=&gt;. And the additional assignment would be password and character variety.

After the additional assignment, my instructor told me that I needed to add a return statement under my for loops. Once the user picks their length and characters, the password would show, and the loop would stop.

After that, he told me that I needed to wrap my if statements, alerts, and my for loops in a generate password function.

Lastly, he told me that I needed two alerts just if the user doesn't choose at least one character or, their password length isn't between 8 & 128, which required the "or" operator.
